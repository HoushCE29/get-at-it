# Get At It Chrome Extension
Sick of your organization managing your browser and forcing your startup preferences, which opens some webpage you don't need or care about?

Then this extension is for you. You got things to do, so get at it.

## How Does It Work?
This simple worker extension listens for the `onStartup` event and then updates the current active tab to open up the URL of the first bookmark found.

## Set Up
  1. In Chrome, go to `Extensions` -> `Managed extensions`.
  2. In the top right, turn on `Developer mode`.
  3. In the top left, select `Load unpacked`.
  4. Select the `chrome` directory in this project.
  5. Move the desired page to load on startup to the very first bookmark.
  6. Restart Chrome to observe the new behavior.

## Can I Get This On The Chrome Store?
No. I'm too cheap to pay the $5 fee to publish there.
