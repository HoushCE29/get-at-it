# Get At It Chrome Extension
Sick of your organization managing your browser and forcing your startup preferences to open some webpage you don't need or care about?

Then this extension is for you.

## How Does It Work?
This simple worker extension listens for the `onStartup` event and then updates the current active tab to open up the URL of the first bookmark found.

## Set Up
Enable developer mode and load unpacked extension, pointing at the `chrome` directory. Then, make sure the webpage you wish to open on startup is bookmarked as the very first bookmark.

## Can I Get This On The Chrome Store?
No. I'm too cheap to pay the $5 fee to publish there.
